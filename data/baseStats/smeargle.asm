;SmeargleBaseStats:: kind of pointless to add unless I programm in sketch, but could give it a crazy movelist with all the most common sketched moves instead... idk. Smeargle doesn't seem to be very popular either, although I kind of like it that base attack is just freakin' awful. maybe boost from 20 to 50, at least..
